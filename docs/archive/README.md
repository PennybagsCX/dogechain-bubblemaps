# Archived Files

This directory contains obsolete development and testing files that are no longer actively used in the project but are being preserved for historical reference.

## Archived Files

### Factory Discovery Tools

- **factory-discovery.html** (13.9 KB) - Original standalone DEX factory discovery tool that scanned Dogechain blockchain for Uniswap V2-style factory contracts
- **factory-discovery-v2.html** (15.8 KB) - Enhanced version with alternative discovery methods (working backwards from known LP pairs)
- **comprehensive-scanner.html** (17.4 KB) - Comprehensive DEX/LP pool scanner
- **manual-factory-entry.html** (13.3 KB) - Manual factory entry interface

### Console/Debug Documentation

- **console.md** (172 KB) - Historical console logs and debugging documentation
- **connection-point-console.md** (90.8 KB) - Connection point console documentation

## Why Were These Archived?

These files were standalone HTML tools and documentation created during the initial development phase for:

- Discovering and cataloging DEX factory contracts on Dogechain
- Manual testing and debugging of blockchain connections
- Console logging and diagnostics

They are no longer needed because:

1. The factories are now managed through the application's database and configuration files
2. Factory discovery has been integrated into the main application
3. Console debugging has been replaced with proper logging infrastructure
4. No references to these files exist in the active codebase

## Date Archived

January 31, 2026

## Archive Purpose

These files are preserved for:

- Historical reference
- Understanding the development process
- Potential future debugging needs (if similar tools are required)

## Note

These files are **not** built or deployed with the application. They are standalone development artifacts.
